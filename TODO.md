# TODO — AI News Platform (5min-ai-news)

Tracks implementation progress against the architecture in
[`project.md`](project.md). Update this file as work completes or
new work is identified — check items off in place rather than
deleting history, so it stays a running log.

## Done

### Core pipeline (pre-existing, per README "Current slice")
- [x] FastAPI API scaffold
- [x] PostgreSQL schema managed via Alembic
- [x] Redis + Celery worker
- [x] Multi-source RSS ingestion with deterministic AI-relevance filter
- [x] Deterministic duplicate-story detection (title similarity + time window)
- [x] Multi-factor ranking engine (recency, source credibility, AI
      relevance, cross-source momentum) + Top-25/5-backup selection,
      persisted as an "Episode"

### This session — 2026-09-15
- [x] Read `project.md` (architecture baseline) and full repo, reviewed every app file
- [x] Stopped stale containers running under the old `5min-ai-news` prefix before rebuilding
- [x] Fixed `docker-compose.yml` project name mismatch (`ai-news-platform` → `5min-ai-news`)
      so Compose reuses the real Postgres volume instead of silently creating an empty one
- [x] Added naming note to `README.md`: `5min-ai-news` = repo/dev name,
      "AI News Platform" = production/public brand
- [x] Built and started the stack (`docker compose up --build -d`), verified all 4
      services (api, worker, postgres, redis) healthy
- [x] Found and documented critical bug: no baseline Alembic migration created the
      `stories` table — `alembic upgrade head` failed on a fresh DB, breaking every
      data endpoint (ingestion, dedup, ranking, `/api/v1/stories`)
- [x] Wrote up findings in `errors.md` (renamed from `errors.txt`)
- [x] Added `alembic/versions/6f1e2a7b9c04_create_stories_table.py` as the true
      baseline migration; re-pointed `996b16094585`'s `down_revision` to it
- [x] Verified `alembic upgrade head` succeeds cleanly on a fresh DB (4 tables created)
- [x] Re-tested full pipeline end-to-end: ingestion (26 stories inserted from 2153
      seen across 8 sources) → dedup (0 duplicates, expected on first run) →
      ranking/episode selection (16 stories ranked and scored correctly)
- [x] Removed orphaned, empty `ai-news-platform_postgres_data` Docker volume
- [x] Renamed `project.txt` → `project.md`, `errors.txt` → `errors.md`
- [x] Created this `TODO.md` to track ongoing work
- [x] Ran a stability pass: ~15 min of live use (repeated ingestion/dedup/ranking
      triggers), all 4 containers stayed healthy, ingestion confirmed idempotent
      on re-run, dedup stable, 404s and query-param clamping verified correct.
      See `errors.md` sections 4-5.
- [x] Fixed the `run_date` validation bug: `trigger_ranking_selection()` now
      validates with `date.fromisoformat()` and returns HTTP 422 with a clear
      message on bad input, instead of silently queuing a task that fails in
      the worker. Verified against the live API. See `errors.md` §4 update.

## Known issues / follow-ups

- [ ] `worker` container runs Celery as root (harmless locally, but the image has
      no non-root user — should fix before any production deployment)
- [ ] No automated tests exist yet for ingestion/dedup/ranking logic — all
      verification so far has been manual end-to-end runs against live RSS feeds
- [ ] Two RSS sources are disabled and need real fixes, not just a flag:
      VentureBeat AI (Vercel bot challenge, HTTP 429) and Microsoft AI Blog
      (HTTP 410 Gone, needs a replacement feed URL) — see `app/sources/registry.py`
- [ ] Potential race condition (untested, low likelihood at current scale):
      two concurrent ingestion runs could both pass the per-URL existence
      check before either commits, then collide on the `uq_stories_url`
      constraint — the broad per-source `except Exception` would roll back
      and lose that entire source's batch, not just the colliding row. Only
      matters if ingestion is ever triggered concurrently (not the case with
      a single daily scheduler). See `errors.md` §5.

## Next up (near-term, per architecture but not yet built)

- [ ] Fact Extraction phase (claims, dates, companies, products, events)
- [ ] Verification Engine (cross-source confirmation before a story is
      publishable) — currently the pipeline ranks AI-candidate stories directly,
      with no separate verified/unverified gate
- [ ] Editorial Dashboard (human review of Top 30: edit, reorder, replace
      defective stories with backups, approve/reject)
- [ ] Scheduled collection cycle (10 PM / 1 AM / 3:30 AM IST cutoff) — all
      pipeline stages are currently triggered manually via `curl`

## Future phases (per `project.md`, not started)

- [ ] Script Generation (fact-based script: headline, summary, why it matters, sources)
- [ ] Voice Generation (one branded AI voice)
- [ ] Visual/Asset Engine (avatar, visuals, screenshots, motion graphics, music)
- [ ] Video Composition (voice + visuals + avatar + captions + branding)
- [ ] Automated Video QA (story count, AI-only, sources, captions, audio, duration)
- [ ] Final Human Approval workflow
- [ ] Publishing Worker (YouTube + Instagram)
- [ ] Analytics Worker (views, retention, watch time, shares, likes/comments, followers)
- [ ] Notification Worker (failure alerts)
- [ ] Optimization Engine (feed analytics back into ranking)
- [ ] AWS evolution (EventBridge scheduled jobs, RDS, S3)
- [ ] Kubernetes/EKS evolution
